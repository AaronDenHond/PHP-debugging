# PHP-debugging

exercise 1: still a bit hard to grasp the idea of 'parameters' as placeholder values, but understand the function

exercise 2: change index, easy exercise 

exercise 3: works by using single and double quotes, and changing the end value of the echo subtr, BUT 
issues with the backticks? cant use with strict typing?? check later...

exercise 4: & in if condition makes it so the code runs for every element, which is a day here.

exercise 5 : first time really using the debugger. On step in we see we need to stop the loop before 'aa' gets added.
the second value in the for loop checks wether to run the loop or not, so if we can say we want the loop to run
for as long as the string value added won't be 'aa'.
